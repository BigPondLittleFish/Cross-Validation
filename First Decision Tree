 # First, we need to create a binary out of the continuous variable "Sales" in order to observe it.
 
High <- ifelse(Sales <= 8, "No", "Yes")

# Then, we merge the old set with our newly created variable

Carseats <- data.frame(Carseats, High)  

# We then construct our tree... 
# "-Sales" becuase "High" is replacing it and in our model by using "." we are saying use everything else, but need
# to exclude that variable specifically. 

tree.carseats <- tree(High ~. -Sales, Carseats)

# We need to seperate the data into two sets, so we divide it in half (K = 2)...

# For consistency in replicating our test we need to set a seed... I chose 2 arbitrarily.

set.seed(2)

# Set half of the data aside for the training data (Orginal set has 400 observations).

train <- sample(1:nrow(Carseats), 200) 

# Create our test set by removing the training observations from the original data

# Remove the training observations from our vector of interest that we created at begining

# Create a model with training data 

tree.carseats <- tree(High ~. - Sales, Carseats, subset = train)

# Check prediciton rate of training data

# Add the "Yes/Yes" and the "No/No" together and divide by the test observation number (200).

# This means that this approach leasds to a 71.5% correct prediction rate in the test data set.

# Now is when we may want to consider pruning, to try and minimize our prediction error. 
# We do this using cross validation to odetermine the optimal level of tree complexity. 

# Set a new seed set.seed(3)

# Note that the tree with the lowest cross-validation error rate is 
# the one with 9 terminal nodes, and has 50 cross-validation errors. 
# We now plot the error rate as a function of both size and k. 

plot(cv.carseats$size, cv.carseats$dev, type = "b")
plot(cv.carseats$dev, cv.carseats$size, type = "b")

# We can look at these side by side and visually observe the 9 terminal nodes as best choice

# We then prune our original tree and graph it 
prune.carseats <- prune.misclass(tree.carseats, best = 9)

# How well does this pruned tree preform on the test data set?

((94+60)/200)*100 

# Now we have 77% classification accuracy and our tree is more easy to interpret! This is what we want 
# If we increased the "best = " value in our prune.misclass() from 9 to 15, for example,
# our classification accuracy would decrease and the tree would be harder to read.

# Lets try to display this result in a confusion matrix
